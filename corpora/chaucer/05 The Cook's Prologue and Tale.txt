4331	`Ne bryng nat every man into thyn hous,'	`Do not bring every man into thy house,'
4332	For herberwynge by nyghte is perilous.	For providing lodging by night is perilous.
4333	Wel oghte a man avysed for to be	Well ought a man to take heed
4334	Whom that he broghte into his pryvetee.	Whom he brings into his private home.
4335	I pray to God, so yeve me sorwe and care	I pray to God, give me sorrow and care

4338	He hadde a jape of malice in the derk.	He had a malicious trick played on him in the dark.
4339	But God forbede that we stynte heere;	But God forbid that we stop here;
4340	And therfore, if ye vouche-sauf to heere	And therefore, if you agree to hear
4341	A tale of me, that am a povre man,	A tale by me, who am a poor man,
4342	I wol yow telle, as wel as evere I kan,	I will tell you, as well as ever I can,

4344	Oure Hoost answerde and seide, "I graunte it thee.	Our Host answered and said, "I grant it to thee.
4345	Now telle on, Roger; looke that it be good,	Now tell on, Roger; look that it be good,
4346	For many a pastee hastow laten blood,	For of many a pastry hast thou drawn out the gravy,
4347	And many a Jakke of Dovere hastow soold	And many a Jack of Dover (a kind of pie) hast thou sold
4348	That hath been twies hoot and twies coold.	That has been twice hot and twice cold.
4349	Of many a pilgrym hastow Cristes curs,	Of many a pilgrim hast thou Christ's curse,
4350	For of thy percely yet they fare the wors,	For of thy parsley yet they fare the worse,
4351	That they han eten with thy stubbel goos,	Which they have eaten with thy stubble-fed goose,
4352	For in thy shoppe is many a flye loos.	For in thy shop is many a fly loose.
4353	Now telle on, gentil Roger by thy name.	Now tell on, gentle Roger by thy name.

4356	"Thou seist ful sooth," quod Roger, "by my fey!	"Thou sayest the truth," said Roger, "by my faith!
4357	But `sooth pley, quaad pley,' as the Flemyng seith.	But `a true jest is a bad jest,' as the Fleming says.
4358	And therfore, Herry Bailly, by thy feith,	And therefore, Harry Bailly, by thy faith,
4359	Be thou nat wrooth, er we departen heer,	Be thou not angry, ere we depart here,
4360	Though that my tale be of an hostileer.	Even though my tale is of an inn-keeper.
4361	But nathelees I wol nat telle it yit;	But nonetheless I will not tell it yet;
4362	But er we parte, ywis, thou shalt be quit."	But before we part, indeed, thou shalt be repaid."
4363	And therwithal he lough and made cheere,	And with that he laughed and made good cheer,
4364	And seyde his tale, as ye shul after heere.	And told his tale, as you shall next hear.
Heere bigynneth the Cookes Tale.	Here begins the Cook's Tale.
4365	A prentys whilom dwelled in oure citee,	A apprentice once dwelt in our city,
4366	And of a craft of vitailliers was hee.	And of a craft of food merchants was he.
4367	Gaillard he was as goldfynch in the shawe,	Gaily dressed he was as is a goldfinch in the woods,
4368	Broun as a berye, a propre short felawe,	Brown as a berry, a good-looking short fellow,
4369	With lokkes blake, ykembd ful fetisly.	With locks black, combed full elegantly.
4370	Dauncen he koude so wel and jolily	He could dance so well and jollily
4371	That he was cleped Perkyn Revelour.	That he was called Perkin Reveler.
4372	He was as ful of love and paramour	He was as full of love and womanizing
4373	As is the hyve ful of hony sweete;	As is the hive full of honey sweet;
4374	Wel was the wenche with hym myghte meete.	Happy was the wench who with him might meet.
4375	At every bridale wolde he synge and hoppe;	At every wedding party he would sing and dance;
4376	He loved bet the taverne than the shoppe.	He loved the tavern better than the shop.
4377	For whan ther any ridyng was in Chepe,	For when there was any procession in Cheapside,
4378	Out of the shoppe thider wolde he lepe --	Out of the shop thither would he leap --
4379	Til that he hadde al the sighte yseyn,	Until that he had all the sight seen,
4380	And daunced wel, he wolde nat come ayeyn --	And danced well, he would not come back--
4381	And gadered hym a meynee of his sort	And gathered him a company of his sort
4382	To hoppe and synge and maken swich disport;	To dance and sing and make such merriment;
4383	And ther they setten stevene for to meete,	And there they agreed on a time to meet,
4384	To pleyen at the dys in swich a streete.	To play at dice in such and such a street.
4385	For in the toune nas ther no prentys	For in the town there was no apprentice
4386	That fairer koude caste a paire of dys	That could better throw a pair of dice
4387	Than Perkyn koude, and therto he was free	Than Perkin could, and thereto he was free
4388	Of his dispense, in place of pryvetee.	In his spending, in a private place.
4389	That fond his maister wel in his chaffare,	That found his master easily in his business accounts,
4390	For often tyme he foond his box ful bare.	For many times he found his cash box completely bare.
4391	For sikerly a prentys revelour	For surely (in the case of) an revelling apprentice
4392	That haunteth dys, riot, or paramour,	Who makes a practice of dicing, debauchery, or womanizing,
4393	His maister shal it in his shoppe abye,	His master shall pay for it in his shop,
4394	Al have he no part of the mynstralcye.	Even though he has no share of the entertainment (for which he pays).
4395	For thefte and riot, they been convertible,	For theft and debauchery, they are interchangeable.
4396	Al konne he pleye on gyterne or ribible.	Even though he knows how to play on guitar or fiddle.
4397	Revel and trouthe, as in a lowe degree,	Revelling and honesty, in one of low degree,
4398	They been ful wrothe al day, as men may see.	Are always incompatible, as anyone can see.
4399	This joly prentys with his maister bood,	This jolly apprentice with his master remained,
4400	Til he were ny out of his prentishood,	Until he was nearly out of his apprenticeship,
4401	Al were he snybbed bothe erly and late,	Although he was rebuked both early and late,
4402	And somtyme lad with revel to Newegate.	And sometimes taken (as a prisoner) with music to Newgate prison.
4403	But atte laste his maister hym bithoghte,	But at the last his master remembered,
4404	Upon a day, whan he his papir soghte,	Upon a day, when Perkin sought his certificate of release,
4405	Of a proverbe that seith this same word:	A proverb that says this same word:
4406	"Wel bet is roten appul out of hoord	"Well better is a rotten apple out of the store
4407	Than that it rotie al the remenaunt."	Than that it rot al the remnant."
4408	So fareth it by a riotous servaunt;	So fares it with a debauched servant;
4409	It is ful lasse harm to lete hym pace,	It is much less harm to let him go away,
4410	Than he shende alle the servantz in the place.	Than that he should ruin all the servants in the place.
4411	Therfore his maister yaf hym acquitance,	Therefore his master gave him his certificate,
4412	And bad hym go, with sorwe and with meschance!	And ordered him to go, with sorrow and with bad luck!
4413	And thus this joly prentys hadde his leve.	And thus this jolly apprentice had his leave.
4414	Now lat hym riote al the nyght or leve.	Now let him revel all the night or leave off (do as he chooses).
4415	And for ther is no theef withoute a lowke,	And because there is no thief without an accomplice,
4416	That helpeth hym to wasten and to sowke	Who helps him to waste and to consume
4417	Of that he brybe kan or borwe may,	That which he can steal or may borrow,
4418	Anon he sente his bed and his array	Right away he sent his bed and his clothing
4419	Unto a compeer of his owene sort,	Unto a companion of his own sort,
4420	That lovede dys, and revel, and disport,	Who loved dicing, and revelling, and having fun,
4421	And hadde a wyf that heeld for contenance	And had a wife that kept for the sake of appearances
4422	A shoppe, and swyved for hir sustenance.	A shop, and screwed for her living.
