3371	Fro day to day this joly Absolon	From day to day this elegant Absolon
3372	So woweth hire that hym is wo bigon.	So woos her that he is in a sorry state.
3373	He waketh al the nyght and al the day;	He stays awake all the night and all the day;
3374	He kembeth his lokkes brode, and made hym gay;	He combs his flowing locks, and dressed himself elegantly;
3375	He woweth hire by meenes and brocage,	He woos her by go-betweens and agents,
3376	And swoor he wolde been hir owene page;	And swore he would be her own servant;
3377	He syngeth, brokkynge as a nyghtyngale;	He sings, trilling like a nightingale;
3378	He sente hire pyment, meeth, and spiced ale,	He sent her sweetened wine, mead, and spiced ale,
3379	And wafres, pipyng hoot out of the gleede;	And wafers, piping hot out of the fire;
3380	And, for she was of town, he profred meede;	And, because she was a townie, he offered money;
3381	For som folk wol ben wonnen for richesse,	For some folk will be won for riches,
3382	And somme for strokes, and somme for gentillesse.	And some by force, and some for noble character.
3383	Somtyme, to shewe his lightnesse and maistrye,	Sometimes, to show his agility and skill,
3384	He pleyeth Herodes upon a scaffold hye.	He plays Herod upon a high stage.
3385	But what availleth hym as in this cas?	But what good does it do him in this case?
3386	She loveth so this hende Nicholas	She so loves this clever Nicholas
3387	That Absolon may blowe the bukkes horn;	That Absolon may go whistle;
3388	He ne hadde for his labour but a scorn.	He had for his labor nothing but scorn.
3389	And thus she maketh Absolon hire ape,	And thus she makes Absolon her fool,
3390	And al his ernest turneth til a jape.	And turns all his earnestness into a joke.
3391	Ful sooth is this proverbe, it is no lye,	Very true is this proverb, it is no lie,
3392	Men seyn right thus: "Alwey the nye slye	Men say right thus: "Always the nearby sly one
3393	Maketh the ferre leeve to be looth."	Makes the distant loved one to be disliked."
3394	For though that Absolon be wood or wrooth,	For though Absolon be crazed or angry,
3395	By cause that he fer was from hire sight,	Because he was far from her sight,
3396	This nye Nicholas stood in his light.	This nearby Nicholas cast him in the shadow.
3397	Now ber thee wel, thou hende Nicholas,	Now bear thyself well, thou clever Nicholas,
3398	For Absolon may waille and synge "allas."	For Absolon may wail and sing "alas."
3399	And so bifel it on a Saterday,	And so it happened on a Saturday,
3400	This carpenter was goon til Osenay;	This carpenter was gone to Osenay;
3401	And hende Nicholas and Alisoun	And clever Nicholas and Alisoun
3402	Acorded been to this conclusioun,	Are agreed on this plan,
3403	That Nicholas shal shapen hym a wyle	That Nicholas shall devise a trick
3404	This sely jalous housbonde to bigyle;	To beguile this hapless jealous husband;

3406	She sholde slepen in his arm al nyght,	She should sleep in his arms all night,
3407	For this was his desir and hire also.	For this was his desire and hers also.
3408	And right anon, withouten wordes mo,	And right away, without more words,
3409	This Nicholas no lenger wolde tarie,	This Nicholas no longer would tarry,
3410	But dooth ful softe unto his chambre carie	But has carried very quietly unto his chamber
3411	Bothe mete and drynke for a day or tweye,	Both food and drink for a day or two,
3412	And to hire housbonde bad hire for to seye,	And told her to say to her husband,
3413	If that he axed after Nicholas,	If he asked about Nicholas,
3414	She sholde seye she nyste where he was;	She should say she knew not where he was;
3415	Of al that day she saugh hym nat with ye;	Of all that day she saw him not with eye;
3416	She trowed that he was in maladye,	She believed that he was ill,
3417	For, for no cry hir mayde koude hym calle,	Because, for no shout could her maid call him,
3418	He nolde answere for thyng that myghte falle.	He would not answer for anything that might befall.
3419	This passeth forth al thilke Saterday,	This goes on all that same Saturday,
3420	That Nicholas stille in his chambre lay,	That Nicholas still in his chamber lay,
3421	And eet and sleep, or dide what hym leste,	And ate and slept, or did what he pleased,

3423	This sely carpenter hath greet merveyle	This hapless carpenter has great marvel

3445	As he had kiked on the newe moone.	As if he were gazing on the new moon.
3446	Adoun he gooth, and tolde his maister soone	Down he goes, and told his master immediately
3447	In what array he saugh this ilke man.	In what condition he saw this same man.

3455	Ye, blessed be alwey a lewed man	Yes, blessed be always an unlearned man
3456	That noght but oonly his bileve kan!	Who knows nothing but only his belief!
3457	So ferde another clerk with astromye;	So fared another clerk with astronomy;
3458	He walked in the feeldes for to prye	He walked in the fields to look
3459	Upon the sterres, what ther sholde bifalle,	Upon the stars, (to find) there what should happen,
3460	Til he was in a marle-pit yfalle;	Until he was fallen in a fertilizer pit;
3461	He saugh nat that. But yet, by Seint Thomas,	He did not see that. But yet, by Saint Thomas,
3462	Me reweth soore of hende Nicholas.	I feel very sorry for clever Nicholas.
3463	He shal be rated of his studiyng,	He shall be scolded for his studying,
