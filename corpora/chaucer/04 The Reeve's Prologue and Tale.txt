3855	Whan folk hadde laughen at this nyce cas	When folk had laughed at this foolish business
3856	Of Absolon and hende Nicholas,	Of Absolon and clever Nicholas,
3857	Diverse folk diversely they seyde,	Different folk said different opinions,
3858	But for the moore part they loughe and pleyde.	But for the most part they laughed and enjoyed themselves.
3859	Ne at this tale I saugh no man hym greve,	And at this tale I saw no man aggrieved,
3860	But it were oonly Osewold the Reve.	Except for only Osewold the Reeve.
3861	By cause he was of carpenteris craft,	Because he was of the carpenter's craft,
3862	A litel ire is in his herte ylaft;	A little anger is left in his heart;
3863	He gan to grucche, and blamed it a lite.	He began to grouch, and criticized it a little.
3864	"So theek," quod he, "ful wel koude I thee quite	"As I may prosper," said he, "very well could I repay thee
3865	With bleryng of a proud milleres ye,	With (a tale of the) blearing of a proud miller's eye (tricking him),
3866	If that me liste speke of ribaudye.	If I wanted to speak of ribaldry.
3867	But ik am oold; me list not pley for age;	But I am old; because of age I do not want to play;
3868	Gras tyme is doon; my fodder is now forage;	Grass time is done; my fodder is now dry straw;
3869	This white top writeth myne olde yeris;	This white head reveals my old years;
3870	Myn herte is also mowled as myne heris,	My heart is as moldy as my hairs,
3871	But if I fare as dooth an open-ers --	Unless I fare as does the fruit of the medlar --
3872	That ilke fruyt is ever lenger the wers,	That same fruit continually grows worse,
3873	Til it be roten in mullok or in stree.	Until it is rotten in rubbish or in straw.
3874	We olde men, I drede, so fare we:	We old men, I fear, fare like that:
3875	Til we be roten, kan we nat be rype;	Until we are rotten, we can not be ripe;
3876	We hoppen alwey whil that the world wol pype.	We dance always while the world will pipe.
3877	For in oure wyl ther stiketh evere a nayl,	For in our will there sticks ever a nail,
3878	To have an hoor heed and a grene tayl,	To have a white head and a green tail,
3879	As hath a leek; for thogh oure myght be goon,	As a leek has; for though our power is gone,
3880	Oure wyl desireth folie evere in oon.	Our will desires folly continually.
3881	For whan we may nat doon, than wol we speke;	For when we can not do anything, then will we talk about it;
3882	Yet in oure asshen olde is fyr yreke.	Yet in our old ashes fire is raked over (covered).
3883	"Foure gleedes han we, which I shal devyse --	"Four live coals have we, which I shall describe --
3884	Avauntyng, liyng, anger, coveitise;	Boasting, lying, anger, greed;
3885	Thise foure sparkles longen unto eelde.	These four little sparks belong to old age.
3886	Oure olde lemes mowe wel been unweelde,	Our old limbs may well be feeble,
3887	But wyl ne shal nat faillen, that is sooth.	But desire shall not be lacking, that is truth.
3888	And yet ik have alwey a coltes tooth,	And yet I have always a young man's desires,
3889	As many a yeer as it is passed henne	As many years as have passed hence
3890	Syn that my tappe of lif bigan to renne.	Since my tap of life began to run.
3891	For sikerly, whan I was bore, anon	For surely, when I was born, immediately
3892	Deeth drough the tappe of lyf and leet it gon,	Death turned on the spigot of life and let it flow,
3893	And ever sithe hath so the tappe yronne	And ever since the tap has so run
3894	Til that almoost al empty is the tonne.	Until the barrel is almost all empty.
3895	The streem of lyf now droppeth on the chymbe.	The stream of life now drops on the rim.
3896	The sely tonge may wel rynge and chymbe	The foolish tongue may well ring and chime
3897	Of wrecchednesse that passed is ful yoore;	About wretchedness that passed long ago;
3898	With olde folk, save dotage, is namoore!"	With old folk, save dotage, there is no more!"
3899	Whan that oure Hoost hadde herd this sermonyng,	When our Host had heard this sermon making,
3900	He gan to speke as lordly as a kyng.	He began to speak as lordly as a king.
3901	He seide, "What amounteth al this wit?	He said, "What amounts all this wit?
3902	What shul we speke alday of hooly writ?	What! shall we speak all day of holy writ?
3903	The devel made a reve for to preche,	The devil made a reeve to preach,
3904	Or of a soutere a shipman or a leche.	Or of a cobbler made a shipman or a physician.
3905	Sey forth thy tale, and tarie nat the tyme.	Say forth thy tale, and do not waste the time.
3906	Lo Depeford, and it is half-wey pryme!	Lo Deptford, and it is almost seven thirty!
3907	Lo Grenewych, ther many a shrewe is inne!	Lo Greenwich, in which is many a rascal!
3908	It were al tyme thy tale to bigynne."	It is well time to begin thy tale."
3909	"Now, sires," quod this Osewold the Reve,	"Now, sires," said this Osewold the Reeve,
3910	"I pray yow alle that ye nat yow greve,	"I pray yow all that you not be displeased,
3911	Thogh I answere, and somdeel sette his howve;	Though I answer (him), and somewhat make a fool of him;
3912	For leveful is with force force of-showve.	For it is permissable to repel force with force.
3913	"This dronke Millere hath ytoold us heer	"This drunk Miller has told us here
3914	How that bigyled was a carpenteer,	How a carpenter was tricked,
3915	Peraventure in scorn, for I am oon.	Perhaps in scorn, for I am one.
3916	And, by youre leve, I shal hym quite anoon;	And, by your leave, I shall repay him right now;
3917	Right in his cherles termes wol I speke.	Right in his churl's terms will I speak.
3918	I pray to God his nekke mote to-breke;	I pray to God his neck may break into pieces;
3919	He kan wel in myn eye seen a stalke,	He can well in my eye see a piece of straw,
3920	But in his owene he kan nat seen a balke."	But in his own he can not see a large piece of timber."
	Heere bigynneth the Reves Tale.	Here begins the Reeve's Tale.

3951	A ful fair sighte was it upon hem two;	A very fair sight was it to look upon those two;
3952	On halydayes biforn hire wolde he go	On holidays before her would he go
3953	With his typet wounde aboute his heed,	With the tip of his hood wound about his head,
3954	And she cam after in a gyte of reed;	And she came after in a gown of red;
3955	And Symkyn hadde hosen of the same.	And Symkyn had hose of the same color.
3956	Ther dorste no wight clepen hire but "dame";	There dared no one call her anything but "lady";

3962	Algate they wolde hire wyves wenden so.	At least they would like their wives to think so.
3963	And eek, for she was somdel smoterlich,	And also, because she was a bit besmirched (by her illegitimacy),
3964	She was as digne as water in a dich,	She was as haughty as water in a ditch,

4091	Toward the fen, bothe Aleyn and eek John.	Toward the fen, both Aleyn and also John.
4092	And whan the millere saugh that they were gon,	And when the miller saw that they were gone,
4093	He half a busshel of hir flour hath take,	He half a bushel of their flour has taken,
4094	And bad his wyf go knede it in a cake.	And ordered his wife to go knead it in a cake.
4095	He seyde, "I trowe the clerkes were aferd.	He said, "I suppose the clerks were leery (of what I might do).
4096	Yet kan a millere make a clerkes berd,	Yet can a miller make a clerk's beard (trick a clerk),
4097	For al his art; now lat hem goon hir weye!	Despite all his learning; now let them go their way!
4098	Lo, wher he gooth! Ye, lat the children pleye.	Lo, there he goes! Yes, let the children play.

4101	With "Keep! Keep! Stand! Stand! Jossa, warderere,	With "Stop! Stop! Stand! Stand! Down there, watch out behind,
4102	Ga whistle thou, and I shal kepe hym heere!"	Go whistle thou, and I shall catch him here!"
4103	But shortly, til that it was verray nyght,	But shortly, until that it was truly night,
4104	They koude nat, though they dide al hir myght,	They could not, though they did al their might,
4105	Hir capul cacche, he ran alwey so faste,	Catch their horse, he ran always so fast,
4106	Til in a dych they caughte hym atte laste.	Until in a ditch they caught him at the last.

4273	And by the throte-bolle he caughte Alayn,	And by the Adam's apple he caught Alayn,
4274	And he hente hym despitously agayn,	And he seized him angrily in turn,
4275	And on the nose he smoot hym with his fest.	And on the nose he smote him with his fist.
4276	Doun ran the blody streem upon his brest;	Down ran the bloody stream upon his breast;

4293	And graspeth by the walles to and fro,	And grasps by the walls to and fro,
4294	To fynde a staf; and she stirte up also,	To find a staff; and she leaped up also,
4295	And knew the estres bet than dide this John,	And knew the interior of the house better than did this John,
4296	And by the wal a staf she foond anon,	And by the wall a staff she found right away,
4297	And saugh a litel shymeryng of a light,	And saw a little glimmering of a light,
4298	For at an hole in shoon the moone bright,	For at a hole in shone the moon bright,
4299	And by that light she saugh hem bothe two,	And by that light she saw both the two of them,
4300	But sikerly she nyste who was who,	But surely she did not know who was who,
4301	But as she saugh a whit thyng in hir ye.	But she saw a white thing in her eye.

4303	She wende the clerk hadde wered a volupeer,	She thought the clerk had worn a night cap,
4304	And with the staf she drow ay neer and neer,	And with the staff she drew ever nearer and nearer,
4305	And wende han hit this Aleyn at the fulle,	And intended to have hit this Aleyn squarely,
4306	And smoot the millere on the pyled skulle,	And smote the miller on the bald skull,

4312	Of half a busshel flour, ful wel ybake.	Of half a bushel flour, very well baked.
4313	Thus is the proude millere wel ybete,	Thus is the proud miller well beaten,
4314	And hath ylost the gryndynge of the whete,	And has lost the charge for grinding of the wheat,
4315	And payed for the soper everideel	And paid for the supper every bit
4316	Of Aleyn and of John, that bette hym weel.	Of Aleyn and of John, who beat him well.
4317	His wyf is swyved, and his doghter als.	His wife is screwed, and his daughter also.
4318	Lo, swich it is a millere to be fals!	Lo, this is how it is when a miller is false!
4319	And therfore this proverbe is seyd ful sooth,	And therefore this proverb is said very truly,
4320	"Hym thar nat wene wel that yvele dooth."	"One who does evil should not expect good."
4321	A gylour shal hymself bigyled be.	A trickster shall himself be tricked.
4322	And God, that sitteth heighe in magestee,	And God, that sits high in majesty,
4323	Save al this compaignye, grete and smale!	Save al this company, high ranking and low (every one)!
4324	Thus have I quyt the Millere in my tale.	Thus have I repaid the Miller in my tale.
